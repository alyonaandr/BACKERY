        <ul class="modal__list">
          <li>1 5-oz. kumru roll or other soft sesame sandwich roll (see note above)</li>
          <li>1 tbsp. softened butter</li>
          <li>3 oz. sucuk sausage (such as Merve brand), casing removed and sliced 1⁄8 inch thick</li>
          <li>2 1⁄4 oz. sheep milk kasseri cheese, sliced 1⁄4 inch thick</li>
          <li>3 small sour pickle spears (1 oz.)</li>
          <li>1⁄4 cup pickled hot peppers, sliced 1⁄2 inch thick on the bias</li>
          <li>4 1⁄2-inch thick slices Roma tomato (1 1⁄2 oz.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p  class="modal__title">Instructions</p>
        <p class="modal__text">Slice the bread in half lengthwise and spread the inside surfaces with softened butter. Heat a griddle or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat and grill the bread, butter-side down, until it is toasty and browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the roll from the skillet and set aside.</p>
        <p class="modal__text">Cook the sausage slices, about 3 minutes per side, until they are crispy, browned, and curled at the edges. Remove the sausage from the pan and place on the bottom half of the kumru roll. Do not discard the sausage grease; it will prevent the kasseri from sticking.</p>
        <p class="modal__text">Lay the kasseri cheese in overlapping shingles directly onto the griddle, allowing it to melt and brown in the sausage fat. When it is toasted enough to flip in one piece (about 4 minutes), scrape it up with a metal spatula and continue toasting the other side. About 3 minutes later, lift the fried cheese away from the griddle and place it over the sausage. Top with tomato, pickles, and pickled peppers, tomato slices, and serve with ketchup and mayo if desired.</p>
